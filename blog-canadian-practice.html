                    <p>Canada's healthcare system, often referred to as "Medicare," is a publicly funded, universal healthcare system that provides coverage for medically necessary hospital and physician services to all Canadian citizens and permanent residents.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Key Features:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Universal Coverage:</strong> All eligible residents have access to public health insurance</li>
                        <li><strong>Provincial Administration:</strong> Healthcare is primarily administered by the provinces and territories</li>
                        <li><strong>Public-Private Mix:</strong> While hospital and physician services are publicly funded, prescription medications outside hospitals are generally not covered by the public system</li>
                        <li><strong>Drug Coverage:</strong> A patchwork of public drug plans, private insurance, and out-of-pocket payments</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <div class="note-section">
                        <p><strong>PEBC Exam Tip:</strong> Understanding how different provincial drug plans work and their coverage criteria is important for the PEBC Evaluating Exam.</p>

                </div>

                    <h2><i class="fas fa-balance-scale"></i> Regulatory Framework</h2>
                    
                    <p>Pharmacy practice in Canada is regulated at the provincial/territorial level, with each province having its own regulatory body (College of Pharmacists) that licenses pharmacists and regulates practice.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Provincial Regulation:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Each province has its own Pharmacy Act and regulations</li>
                        <li>Standards of practice may vary slightly between provinces</li>
                        <li>Licensing requirements include PEBC certification, language proficiency, and practical training</li>
                        <li>Continuing education requirements vary by province</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>Unlike some countries where pharmacy regulation is centralized at the national level, Canada's decentralized approach means pharmacists must be familiar with the specific regulations of the province where they practice.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="content-block" id="scope-of-practice">
                    <h2><i class="fas fa-prescription"></i> Expanded Scope of Practice</h2>
                    
                    <p>Canadian pharmacists have seen a significant expansion in their scope of practice over the past decade, with variations across provinces.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Services that may be within a pharmacist's scope (varying by province):</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Prescription adaptation (modifying doses, formulations, etc.)</li>
                        <li>Prescription renewal/extension</li>
                        <li>Independent prescribing for minor ailments</li>
                        <li>Ordering and interpreting lab tests</li>
                        <li>Administering injections (including vaccines)</li>
                        <li>Performing medication reviews</li>
                        <li>Smoking cessation counseling</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>This expanded scope represents a shift toward more clinical, patient-centered care compared to the traditional dispensing role that may be predominant in some other countries.</p>
                    
                    <div class="note-section">

                    <p>Canada uses a unique drug scheduling framework that differs from many other countries:</p>
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Schedule I:</strong> Prescription medications that require a prescription from an authorized prescriber</li>
                        <li><strong>Schedule II:</strong> Behind-the-counter medications that require professional intervention from the pharmacist at the point of sale</li>
                        <li><strong>Schedule III:</strong> Pharmacy-only medications available for self-selection from the self-selection area of the pharmacy</li>
                        <li><strong>Unscheduled:</strong> General retail products that can be sold anywhere</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>This system differs from the prescription/OTC binary classification used in many countries and requires pharmacists to understand the specific requirements for each schedule.</p>

                    <p>Canadian pharmacy practice increasingly emphasizes interprofessional collaboration:</p>
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li>Pharmacists often work as part of healthcare teams</li>
                        <li>Family Health Teams and Primary Care Networks may include pharmacists</li>
                        <li>Hospital pharmacists are integrated into clinical teams</li>
                        <li>Collaborative prescribing arrangements exist in some provinces</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>This collaborative approach may differ from more siloed models of healthcare delivery in some other countries, where pharmacists have limited interaction with other healthcare providers.</p>

                    <p>Canada is a multicultural society with specific considerations for healthcare providers:</p>
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li>Indigenous health considerations and cultural safety</li>
                        <li>Services for diverse immigrant populations</li>

                        <li>Patient-centered care approach</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>Understanding these cultural aspects is essential for effective pharmacy practice in the Canadian context.</p>
