                                    <li>The drug becomes unstable when exposed to air</li>

                                <p><strong>Correct Answer: B</strong></p>
                                <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Sustained-release formulations are designed to release the drug slowly over time through special coating or matrix systems. Crushing the tablet destroys this mechanism, leading to immediate release of the entire dose, which can cause toxicity and reduced efficacy duration.</p>

                                <p><strong>Correct Answer: C</strong></p>
                                <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Metformin is contraindicated when eGFR is <30 mL/min/1.73m² and should be used with caution when eGFR is 30-45 mL/min/1.73m². With an eGFR of 35, this is borderline, but given the patient's age and comorbidities, the pharmacist should contact the prescriber to discuss safer alternatives.</p>

                                <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Medication reconciliation is a patient safety process that involves comparing a patient's medication orders to all medications the patient has been taking, especially at transitions of care (admission, transfer, discharge) to identify and resolve discrepancies.</p>
