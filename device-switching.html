                <h3>Device Switch Cooldown System</h3>
                <p>Our app implements a progressive cooldown system for device switches to maintain security and prevent abuse:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>First Switch: Immediate (no cooldown)</li>
                    <li>Second Switch: 1 hour cooldown</li>
                    <li>Third Switch: 3 hours cooldown</li>
                    <li>Fourth Switch: 24 hours cooldown</li>
                    <li>Fifth Switch: 3 days cooldown</li>
                    <li>Sixth Switch: 7 days cooldown</li>
                    <li>Seventh Switch and beyond: 14 days cooldown</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Important Notes:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Maximum of 1 concurrent active devices per account</li>
                    <li>Device switches are tracked and logged for security</li>
                    <li>Unauthorized devices will be automatically signed out</li>
                    <li>Cooldown periods are strictly enforced and cannot be bypassed</li>
                    <li>The cooldown timer starts when a device switch is initiated</li>
                    <li>Users can view their remaining cooldown time in the settings</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>This policy helps us:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Protect user data and privacy</li>
