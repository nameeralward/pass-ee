                        <h3>Study Efficiency Tips:</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Active Learning:</strong> Instead of passive reading, engage with the material through summarizing, teaching concepts aloud, and creating concept maps</li>
                            <li><strong>Spaced Repetition:</strong> Use the passEE app's spaced repetition feature to optimize your retention of information</li>
                            <li><strong>Question-First Approach:</strong> For topics you're reviewing, try answering questions first, then study the areas where you're weakest</li>
                            <li><strong>Pomodoro Technique:</strong> Study in focused 25-minute intervals with 5-minute breaks to maintain concentration</li>
                            <li><strong>Weekly Assessments:</strong> Test yourself regularly with timed quizzes to build test-taking stamina</li>
