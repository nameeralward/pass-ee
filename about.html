            <div class="story-card">
                <p>Our journey began in 2021 when a group of passionate pharmacists and tech enthusiasts came together with a shared vision: to revolutionize how international pharmacy graduates prepare for their Canadian licensing exams. Having experienced the challenges of exam preparation firsthand, we understood the need for a more intelligent, adaptive, and comprehensive study solution.</p>
                
                <p>What started as a simple question bank has evolved into a sophisticated learning platform, incorporating cutting-edge AI technology and detailed analytics. Over the past three years, we've continuously refined our content and features based on user feedback and the latest developments in pharmacy education.</p>
                
                <p>Today, passEE represents the culmination of countless hours of development, testing, and improvement. We're proud to have helped numerous pharmacy professionals achieve their dreams of practicing in Canada, and we remain committed to our mission of making high-quality exam preparation accessible to all.</p>
